## Overview

Welcome to our Student Management System project! This system is developed in C, leveraging the power of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) through a custom header file. The project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing student records in educational institutions.



## Project Description

The Student Management System is designed to streamline the process of managing student data, including personal information, course details, grades, and attendance records. By utilizing C++ STL containers and algorithms implemented in C, we ensure optimal performance and robust functionality.
